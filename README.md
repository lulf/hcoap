Hcoap is a haskell CoAP library. See http://coap.technology/ for more information about the CoAP
protocol. The library aims to support RFC 7252 specification, and currently only support non-secure
CoAP transport.

The library is split into a high-level API in Network.CoAP.Server and Network.CoAP.Client, and a lower layer API in Network.CoAP.Message for working directly with CoAP messages.
